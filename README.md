#<p align = 'center'> Predicting Readmission of Diabetes Patients </p>

## Problem Definition
Predict if a patient with diabetes will be readmitted to the hospital within 30 days.

In this project I will demonstrate how to build a model predicting readmission in Python using the following steps

1. Data Exploration
2. Feature Engineering
3. Building Training/Validation/Test samples
4. Model selection
5. Performance Evaluation
